Agent and Patch require an input argument of Env for initialization. Also, Agent requires an identity variable termed class_name to enable multi-agent modeling,
There are few conventions that need further explanation to define an environment. Python requires object ownership. Therefore, any object shared between C++ and Python ends, i.e. Patch and Agent objects, needs to be stored in Python end and referenced as a pointer in C++ end. To satisfy this requirement, two template functions of generate_agent and generate_patch are provided to manage the generation and storage of agents and patches,where the generated agent needs to be stored at both Env.agents and Env._repo. The former is the attribute of base class, i.e. Env, and the latter needs to be defined in Python end. 
The discussed requirement can be ignored if the development intends to done in only Python end. 
Using these functions, the defined agents and patches can be accessed in both C++ and Python without further measure. Since patch objects are assumed non-movables, we store agent objects also separately on self.agents to facilitate the iteration process which target only agents.
